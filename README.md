Audio steganography project 
Audio steganography is probably one of the most challenging areas. So, it is hard to find related sources for researchers. The main goal of this project was to provide basic audio steganography algorithms for everyone.
the process of hiding secret information within ordinary media so that the very existence of the message is concealed. It works by embedding messages within images, videos, or audio files. 
In the current generation, privacy-related matters are of concern to every individual that makes steganography to have an imperative role in real-world applications. Audio signals are used as covers more frequently as compared with the other cover signals; the reason being their larger size so that more information can be concealed in the cover. Moreover, digital audio signals possess higher redundancy and high data transmission rate that make these suitable for used as covers. This work focuses on audio steganography-based approaches that have effectuated attention from different researchers with its applicability to audio and speech signal processing for communicating information. In this work, different techniques, along with their algorithms and principles, useful in this regard are reviewed and a compendium to digital audio steganography is presented. Additionally, a comparative study among the existing approaches has been provided along with a critical review that can help the community to investigate particular approach according to the requirement.
the audio steganography can be implement in 
.phase coding
.lsb coding
.echo coding
.parity coding
The work in this paper aims at enhancing the provision of audio steganography by introducing one LSB (Least Significant Bit) coding technique. We design a high bit rate LSB audio watermarking method that reduces embedding distortion of the host audio with increased capacity of secret text.
